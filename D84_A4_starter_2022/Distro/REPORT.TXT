Answer the following questions. Be concise and clear
but explain carefully when needed.

1 .- (1 marks) Train a 1-layer network using the Logistic activation
               function. 

	       Copy/paste the reported classification rates for:

		   NOTE: Everything uses 50 max_iters
	 	
	       Training data (last training round): 0.837138

	       Testing data: 0.850723

2 .- (1 marks) Repeat the process using the hyperbolic tangent activation
	       function.

		   Training : 0.899192

		   Testing : 0.899786


3 .- (1 marks) Which type of activation function yielded the best classification
	       results? which one learned faster?
		   
		   Hyperbolic tangent resulted in the best classification.
		   Hyperbolic tangent also learned faster than logistic.

4 .- (1 marks) Train a 2-layer network with hyperbolic-tangent activation, using
	       150 hidden units. Report the classification rates on training and
	       testing data just as for 1) and 2).

		   Training : 0.979397
		   Testing: 0.961250	       
	       
5 .- (1 marks) Same as 4), except use 10 hidden units instead

		Training: 0.931965
		Testing: 0.911771

6 .- (1 marks) Same as 5), except use 3 hidden units instead

		Training: 0.595867
		Testing: 0.546543

7 .- (3 marks) Comment on the experiments in 4, 5, and 6, and give your conclusion
	       regarding the effect of the number of hidden units on classification
	       accuracy.

		   The higher the number of hidden units that you have, the higher classification
		   accuracy you are able to get. It seems that the rate of this increase is slows down.
		   Meaning that from small number hidden units to bigger number will result in much better
		   result. But from an already large number of hidden units to even larger will not matter as much.

	       What is the network with 3 hidden telling you about this classification
	       problem?

		   Using only 3 hidden units underfits and gives bad classification accuracy, this tells
		   us that our problem is more complicated than to be solved with only 3 hidden units.

8 .- (3 marks) Train the best performing network you can. Use any activation function
	       you wish, and set the number of hidden units so as to achieve the best
	       performance.

	       Number of hidden units used:	500 with hyperbolic and 50 max_iters

	       Classification rate on testing data:	0.966478

9 .- (3 marks) Describe how you would build a network to play the cat
	        and mouse game (move the mouse to help it survive).

		- Describe what the input is in terms of a vector of
		  values
		- Describe what the output layer looks like (how many
		  neurons and what they encode)
		- Describe the error function
		- How many layers should you use?

		For our input, we will be sending the enviroment. This will be
		a vector which has the location of mouse, the cats, the cheese,
		and the walls (always in the same order). Also note that the length
		of this vector is always the same. If we have less cheese or cats than
		the max then the corresponding value will be set to 0 instead of the location.

		The output will have 4 neurons which will represent the four possible moves,
		1st neuron up, 2nd down, 3rd left, 4th right.

		Our error function will be squared error. We will be using it along with
		the logistic function as our activation function. Where the output neuron
		with highest value is picked as the direction to take, and it will penalized
		or rewarded depending on if the direction was correct according to our 
		dataset for training.

		We will have 5 hidden layers each with around 30 neurons.

		Ofcourse, this network will need a lot of training data that tells us what the best move
		is for different game enviroments.
